    <h1>Meet Andrey Nikitin</h1>

<div class="content content--bordered" markdown="1">

Hi, my name is Andrey. I am a junior studying CS at the University of Florida, where I currently work as a level 2 SOC Analyst. Always hungry for knowledge, I've explored many disciplines including astronomy, biochemistry, and quantum computing, until I found my true passion - cybersecurity. Whether it be reverse engineering malware, or shcripting portable programs (get it? The scripts are written in sh), I find joy in understanding the root of how things work. This has inevitably led me to explore every facet of cybersecurity from hardening AD on Windows to implementing PAM backdoors in Linux. In the future, I want to spend more time on social engineering and prompt injection for AI models.

But technical depth is shallow if you can't share that knowledge with others. That's why, as president of UFSIT, UF's cybersecurity club, I've poured just as much energy into my community. Through lectures, study guides, and BlueDaBaDee – a training platform I developed to practice finding and patching vulnerabilities – I mentored my fellow gators. The thrill of competitions drove us to continue honing our skills, eventually winning Best in Defense at SECCDC, a defense competition, and 1st place at CPTC, a pentesting competition. I hope to get a job in Vulnerability Research or Security Engineering, where I can continue to explore my interests and develop useful tools.

# Strategic Communication Experience

In Fall 2025, I enrolled in Writing Strategic Communications. While seemingly unrelated to cybersecurity, this opportunity allowed me to develop versatility in my writing, which I could then use to support cybersecurity organizations and companies. Below is a selection of the work I completed during this time.

This place-based branding piece will walk you through a guided tour of UFSIT’s Career Fair. Flowing between four locations, this project displays my organizational skills and ability to influence emotions through vivid imagery. In order to capture this once-in-a-year event in a timeless piece, each detail was carefully selected to imbue a feeling of serenity and casual joy, which are often missing from the hustle and bustle of a traditional career fair. Descriptive text and accompanying graphics serve to immerse the audience in this corporeal experience, further imprinting the unique nature of this event. Open to any students interested in information security, open up the path to your future career by following us on this walk.

Native advertising aims to mimic the style of an existing site so that it can pose itself as another piece of content, while subtly advertising a product. In this project, I produce a native advertising piece for OnDefend, one of UFSIT’s sponsors, to include in the popular podcast Darknet Diaries. This illustrates my adaptability to new mediums, graphical design skills, and consideration for ethical marketing. Through studying the format of the platform, including the speech patterns of the host Ryan, I was able to author a convincing dialogue, complete with an episode graphic and description. Listen to Episode 162: BlindSpot to learn all about OnDefend’s pentesting history, based on true stories!

The final piece was a content marketing campaign for UFSIT’s second sponsor, Vozzcom. This includes a comprehensive understanding of the company’s position, campaign proposal complete with a release schedule, a signature story piece, as well as a knowledge branding piece. Together, these showcase my aptitude for critical analysis, strategic placement of images to foster a personal connection, and document design capabilities reflecting the company’s themes. As seen upon reading, this campaign accommodates for Vozzcom’s unique B2B model by targeting a unique audience: future employees. By leveraging the company’s reputation, philanthropic efforts, and family history, the campaign will simultaneously improve the quality of Vozzcom’s employees and establish a modern online presence for the company.

# Reflection

Over the course of these projects, I have had to implement a multitude of creative skills once foreign to me. As the only STEM major in the class, I often felt out of place and clueless about common slang, such as ROI. However, as I listened attentively to my instructor and peers, I began picking up the tricks of the trade. When approached with a struggle, I learned to spin it into a strength, leveraging each scenario to my full advantage. On a surface level, this means taking the advertising projects that would normally have no relation to a career in cyber, and using them to further my club’s events and connections. 

However, there are deeper instances of this too. For example, during the planning of the place-based branding, the venue of the UFSIT Career Fair changed multiple times. This is clearly a problem, as the whole point of the place-based branding is to center it around the physical location. So, to minimize wasted effort, I instead focused on the essence of the event – the aspects that should be true regardless of location. This change in thought allowed me to pinpoint what distinguished our event from others, which I could then leverage for the advertising piece. Furthermore, being forced to select 4 locations for the tour actually improved the organization of the event itself by compartmentalizing each feature we had to offer. 

Through these writing assignments, I have learned that I have a knack for descriptive imagery, especially in storytelling. However, I often find that I get so caught up in crafting evocative details, that I often lose the direction of the piece of the whole. Going forward, I need to be more mindful of what my central goal in writing is, and cut down on my descriptions to make my writing more concise and impactful. These are tips I hope to apply in future projects for UFSIT, such as advertising for our fundraiser events.
